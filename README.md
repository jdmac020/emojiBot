Python dabbling with a whimsical goal of tweeting a safari

First attempt at anything python, so be cautious. 

General idea is:

  1--import emojis from source file
    a: day/night (sun and moon)
    b: vegetation
    c: animals
  2--arrange them into a semi-formatted string that paints a landscape
  3--tweet the string into the void at random intervals
